# Currency-Exchange-Rate

My first Application made using vanilla Javascript, HTML & CSS. I will be travelling to Japan at the end of 2024, so i wanted to create something which had some relevence to my personal interests.

The Code will integrate an API to get the latest currency rates.

I followed a Coding tutorial to complete this code, Especially for the javascript required.
